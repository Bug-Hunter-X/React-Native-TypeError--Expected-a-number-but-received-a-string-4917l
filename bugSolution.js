The solution is to ensure that the data type passed to the component matches the expected data type. This can be done by explicitly converting the data type using functions like `parseInt()`, `parseFloat()`, or `Number()`. 

Here's how you can fix the bug in the example above:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React from 'react';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = ({ count }) => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>The count is: {count}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
In this solution, we ensure that the `count` prop is a number before rendering the component. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring.
